- **Subscription Management**: Automatic membership billing
- **Payment Tracking**: Complete transaction audit trail

## 🚛 Driver Workflow System

### Complete Order Process

The driver workflow manages orders through 4 main stages with photo documentation and status validation:

#### 1. **Customer Pickup** 
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/pickup`

**Driver Actions:**
- Takes photo of laundry bag(s) for documentation
- Records actual weight (if different from estimated)
- Updates order status: `scheduled` → `picked_up`

**System Response:**
- Stores `pickup_photo` in Supabase Storage
- Records `measured_weight_lb` for billing adjustments
- Captures `picked_up_at` timestamp and `driver_id`
- Triggers payment authorization adjustment if weight changed

#### 2. **Processing Complete** 
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/processing-complete`

**Laundromat Actions:**
- Staff marks order as finished cleaning
- Updates order status: `processing` → `ready_for_delivery`

**System Response:**
- Records `ready_for_delivery_at` timestamp
- Sends customer notification that items are ready
- Makes order available for delivery pickup

#### 3. **Laundromat Pickup**
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/pickup-laundromat`

**Driver Actions:**
- Collects clean laundry from facility
- Updates order status: `ready_for_delivery` → `en_route_delivery`

**System Response:**
- Records transition timestamp
- Sends customer "out for delivery" notification
- Tracks driver assignment for delivery route

#### 4. **Customer Delivery**
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/dropoff`

**Driver Actions:**
- Takes photo of delivered items as proof of delivery
- Adds optional delivery notes (e.g., "left at door", "handed to customer")
- Updates order status: `en_route_delivery` → `delivered`

**System Response:**
- Stores `delivery_photo` in Supabase Storage
- Records `delivery_notes` and `delivered_at` timestamp
- Captures final payment for actual weight/services
- Triggers customer delivery confirmation

### Status State Machine

The system enforces valid transitions and prevents invalid status changes:

```typescript
// Valid workflow transitions
{ from: 'scheduled', to: 'en_route_pickup', trigger: 'driver_dispatched' }
{ from: 'en_route_pickup', to: 'picked_up', trigger: 'items_collected', requiresData: ['actual_weight'] }
{ from: 'picked_up', to: 'processing', trigger: 'arrived_at_facility' }
{ from: 'processing', to: 'ready_for_delivery', trigger: 'cleaning_completed' }
{ from: 'ready_for_delivery', to: 'en_route_delivery', trigger: 'out_for_delivery' }
{ from: 'en_route_delivery', to: 'delivered', trigger: 'items_delivered' }
{ from: 'delivered', to: 'completed', trigger: 'payment_finalized' }
```

### Order Lifecycle
```
scheduled → en_route_pickup → picked_up → processing → ready_for_delivery → en_route_delivery → delivered → completed
```

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

### Role Hierarchy
```
admin → [driver, laundromat_staff, customer]
driver → [customer]
laundromat_staff → [customer]
customer → []
```

### Usage Examples
```typescript
// Driver workflow endpoints (drivers and admins)
const { user, roles } = await requireRole(cookies, ['driver', 'admin']);

// Laundromat operations (staff and admins)
const { user, roles } = await requireRole(cookies, ['laundromat_staff', 'admin']);

// Helper functions for role checking
if (isDriver(roles)) {
  // Driver or admin access
}
if (isLaundromatStaff(roles)) {
  // Laundromat staff or admin access
}
```

### Access Patterns

| Role | Driver Endpoints | Laundromat Endpoints | Admin Endpoints | Member Features |
|------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| admin | ✅ (inherited) | ✅ (inherited) | ✅ | ✅ (if has membership) |
| driver | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (if has membership) |
| laundromat_staff | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (if has membership) |
| customer | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (if has membership) |

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Business Tables
- **`orders`** - Main order tracking with status, pricing, photos, driver assignments
- **`customers`** - Customer profiles with auth integration
- **`addresses`** - Customer addresses with geolocation
- **`memberships`** - Stripe subscription tracking

### Operational Tables
- **`service_zones`** - Geographic service areas
- **`time_windows`** - Available pickup/delivery slots
- **`daily_capacity`** - Capacity management per zone/window
- **`drivers`** - Driver profiles and vehicle assignments
- **`admins`** - Administrative user access

### Workflow & Audit
- **`order_status_history`** - Complete audit trail for compliance
- **`user_roles`** (view) - Unified role access across all user types
- **`driver_assignments`** - Route optimization and scheduling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account with database
- Stripe account (test & live keys)
- Mapbox account (for address autocomplete)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository]
   cd bol-1
   npm install
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   # 1. Execute unified-roles-migration.sql
   # 2. Set up RLS policies and storage buckets
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update with your keys:
   # - PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   # - PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
   # - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   # - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   # - PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   # - PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

4. **Sample Data** (for testing)
   ```sql
   -- Add test service zones
   INSERT INTO service_zones (name, description) VALUES
   ('Detroit Core', 'Downtown Detroit and surrounding areas');

   -- Add time windows
   INSERT INTO time_windows (label, start_time, end_time) VALUES
   ('Morning', '08:00', '12:00'),
   ('Afternoon', '12:00', '16:00'),
   ('Evening', '16:00', '20:00');

   -- Add daily capacity
   INSERT INTO daily_capacity (service_date, zone_id, time_window_id, pickup_capacity, delivery_capacity)
   SELECT CURRENT_DATE, sz.id, tw.id, 10, 10
   FROM service_zones sz, time_windows tw;
   ```

5. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:4323
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Driver Workflow Test
1. Create test accounts in `drivers` and `admins` tables
2. Place a test order through the booking flow
3. Use driver endpoints to move order through workflow:
   - `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/pickup` (with photo)
   - `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/processing-complete`
   - `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/pickup-laundromat`
   - `POST /api/driver/orders/{id}/dropoff` (with photo)

### Role System Test
```bash
# Test driver can access driver endpoints but not admin endpoints
# Test admin can access all endpoints
# Test proper error responses for unauthorized access
```

### Payment Testing
- Use Stripe test cards: `4242424242424242`
- Test membership signup and billing
- Verify webhook handling in Stripe dashboard

## 🔧 Development Commands
